The MicroPass Server is used to store encrypted data, which is then decrypted on your local device.

The project is written in Golang and uses the [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) framework.
The server uses a PostgreSQL database with an ORM framework called [GORM](https://github.com/go-gorm/gorm).
